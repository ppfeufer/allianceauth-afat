## Code Formatting<a name="code-formatting"></a>

This app is utilizing the [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style.html)
code style. Every commit has to adhere to it.

This repository uses [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) to
verify compliance with formatting rules. To use:

1. Install `pre-commit`.
1. From inside the `allianceauth-afat` root directory, run `pre-commit install`.
1. You're all done! Code will be checked automatically using git hooks.

You can check if your code to commit adheres to the given style by simply running:

```shell script
pre-commit
```

Or to check all files:

```shell script
pre-commit run --all-files
```

The following will be checked by `pre-commit`:

- no trailing whitespaces (excluded are: minified js and css, .po and .mo files)
- one, and only one, empty line at the end of every file (excluded are: minified js
  and css, .po and .mo files)
- line ending is LF
- code formatted according to black code style
- code conforms with flake8

## Contributing via Pull Requests<a name="contributing-via-pull-requests"></a>

To contribute code via pull request, make sure that you fork the repository and branch
your changes from the `development` branch. Only pull requests towards the development
branch will be considered.

Please make sure you have signed the [License Agreement](https://developers.eveonline.com/resource/license-agreement)
by logging in at https://developers.eveonline.com before submitting any pull requests.

### Commits<a name="commits"></a>

Commit headers should be short (not longer than 70 characters) and precise. Use the
commit body for a more detailed explanation of the commit.

Commit headers should be prefixed to state what kind of commit it is.

- `[FEATURE] Foobar` When a new feature is introduced
- `[ADDED] Foobar` When something is added to the code base to enhance existing
  functions
- `[REMOVED] Foobar` When something is removed, like deprecated or unused code
- `[FIX] Foobar` For bug fixes or fixes in general. Ideally followed by an issue ID
- `[CHANGE] Foobar` When Code or appearance has been changed that doesn't fit in any
  of the other categories. Usually for changes in templates or optimisations in the
  Python code itself
- `[MISC] Foobar` When it doesn't fit in anything else

### Model Changes<a name="model-changes"></a>

In case you add changes to the models, please also update the model graph via:

```shell
make graph_models
```

### Test Coverage<a name="test-coverage"></a>

Please make sure your contribution comes with tests covering your additions and
changes. We aim to continuously raise our overall text coverage in this project. Pull
requests lowering the test coverage will not be considered for merging.

You can run tests locally via:

```shell
make coverage
```

The full tox-test suite can be run via:

```shell
make tox_tests
```
