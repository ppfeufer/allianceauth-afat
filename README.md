An Improved FAT/PAP System for [Alliance Auth](https://gitlab.com/allianceauth/allianceauth).

AFAT is a privately maintained whitelabel of ImicusFAT. Updates will only be pushed when ImicusFAT get updates to keep on par with it.

### Feature Highlights/Differences
- FATLink Creation and Population from ESI
- Fleet Type Classification (can be added in the Admin Menu)
- Graphical Statistics Views
- Many Core Functionality Improvements and Fixes

AFAT will work alongside the built-in native FAT System, bFAT and ImicusFAT.
However data does not share, but you can migrate their data to AFAT, for more information see below.

## Installation

### Important
This app is a plugin for Alliance Auth. If you don't have Alliance Auth running already,
please install it first before proceeding.
(see the official [AA installation guide](https://allianceauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/allianceauth.html) for details)

**For users migrating from one of the other FAT systems, please read the specific instructions FIRST.**

### Step 1 - Install app

Make sure you are in the virtual environment (venv) of your Alliance Auth installation.
Then install the latest version:

```bash
pip install allianceauth-afat
```

### Step 2 - Update your AA settings

Configure your AA settings (`local.py`) as follows:

- Add `'afat',` to `INSTALLED_APPS`

### Step 3 - Finalize the installation

Run migrations & copy static files

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
python manage.py migrate
```

Restart your supervisor services for AA.

## Updating

To update your existing installation of ImicusFAT, first enable your
virtual environment (venv) of your Alliance Auth installation.

```bash
pip install -U allianceauth-afat

python manage.py collectstatic
python manage.py migrate
```

Finally restart your supervisor services for AA

## Data Migration 

Right after the **initial** installation and running migrations,
you can import the data from Alliance Auth's native FAT system,
from bFAT or from ImicusFAT if you have used one of these until now.

**!!IMPORTANT!!**

Only do this once and ONLY BEFORE you are using AFAT. A later migration is **not** possible.


#### Import from native FAT

```bash
python myauth/manage.py afat_import_from_allianceauth_fat
```


#### Import from bFAT

```bash
python myauth/manage.py afat_import_from_bfat
```


#### Import from ImicusFAT

```bash
